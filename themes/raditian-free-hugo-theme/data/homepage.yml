  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    I am an Italian computer engineering student, passionate about technology.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    I am a very dynamic person, motivated and ready to learn. The strong interest in computer science encourages me to always get involved. In fact, I practice a lot of physical activity and this has allowed me to never back down and to always accept new challenges, whatever they may be.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    I prefer software but hardware also fascinates me. If next to me there is an electronic device and a screwdriver I can''t use it, especially if I discover that it isn''t working properly!
